CS291A - Mixed and Augemented realit: Project 1
In this homework exercise, you will install and run examples in several XR-enabling SDKs. It is possible that you will run into installation problems with some of these platforms on your specific development platform. In that case, we are interested in how far you got and where the stumbling blocks are.

The deliverable on this assignment is a questionnaire submission that gathers brief experience reports for all of these. Depending on your OS and platform, there will be several additional steps that you will likely proactively need to figure out (e.g. version mismatches, or smth like registering a developer account in Xcode on Mac). Be a researcher, and try to get as far as you can, but feel free to limit your time investment on each of these SDKs to one hour each (you don't have to).

Let's get started with something that doesn't require an installation: web-based AR in the browser:

We'll look at AR.js, https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js and AFrame https://aframe.io/.
A somewhat dated walkthrough (but hopefully still functional) is at https://aframe.io/blog/arjs/
A slightly newer tutorial is at https://levelup.gitconnected.com/simple-augmented-reality-ar-integration-with-a-frame-f625e9dc66b8

Your task: show a model of your choice on your webcam on top of a marker (either printed or shown on a phone/tablet)
